GBA BIOS Dumping Tool

This utility dumps the GBA BIOS by jumping directly into the CpuFastSet
routine in the BIOS, bypassing the region check, and then copying the BIOS
into a flashcart's SRAM.

The expected output is a 16kiB file, with different checksums based on device.
Below are the CPU models and checksums of the expected output, using both the
BIOS's builtin checksumming method, and SHA-256.

Model #  CPU Type     Checksum  SHA-256
AGB-001  CPU AGB A    BAAE187F  fd2547724b505f487e6dcb29ec2ecff3af35a841a77ab2e85fd87350abd36570
