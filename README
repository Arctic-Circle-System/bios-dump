GBA BIOS Dumping Tool

This utility dumps the GBA BIOS by jumping directly into the CpuFastSet
routine in the BIOS, bypassing the region check, and then copying the BIOS
into a flashcart's SRAM.

For demonstration purposes a black-box approach is also included that works
without knowledge of where the CpuFastSet routine is in memory. However,
due to timing concerns it doesn't always dump properly the first time it
tries and runs the checksum to try again if needed.

The expected output is a 16kiB file, with different checksums based on device.
Below are the CPU models and checksums of the expected output, using both the
BIOS's builtin checksumming method, and SHA-256.
